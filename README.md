# Portfolio

## Task

We had to created our portfolio from scratch this week. Our portfolio is used to showcase our skills and talents to employers looking to hire for their company. 

Flexbox and media queries were key components to the sites functionality. Since I don't have any projects YET, I used temporary placeholder images. They will be changed to real applications as I create them in the coming months. 

### Critical requirements included:

* a loaded portfolio with presented with  my name, a recent photo, and links to sections about me, my work, and how to contact me. 
* clickable navigation links to the different sections
* UI scrolls to the section with titled images of my applications
* first application image larger in size than the others
* clickable links to the applications and to contacts
* responsive layout that adapts to various screens and devices
